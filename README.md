# WCF - ServerOverview Plugin

This plugin adds a "Server Overview" page to an WCF1 (Woltlab Community Framework) driven site like the Woltlab Burning Board Lite.

You can use the buildPackage.sh to create an installable tar package for any wcf driven application.

The package will be located in the created build/ directory as installPackage.tar

The building artifacts are also contained inside the build folder.

The lib/ directory could hold the WCF but due to License and/or HitHub availability problems it is neither contained nor linked as submodule. This may change when we create a branch for the WCF2 framework which is located at GitHub.
